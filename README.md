# A simple hangman playable on terminal


## Most important things to do
- Add a check to see if words on wordlist are valid words.

## Things that I could improve
- Turn the fixed-size array of `alreadyTypedChars[]` into a dynamic array  
- Implement a more independent `clearScreen()` function (the current one appends the clear command to the shell history)  
- Add colors
